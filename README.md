# Clifford_Fitzpatrick_CVGAN
Code Repository for Conditional Video Adversarial Network
 Project for EC500 Spring 2017 Final Project

## Scripts in Repository

single_stream_vgan.py - Our implementation of the single stream architecture propsed by Vondrick in his paper "Generating Videos with Scene Dynamics". Written with Keras using a Tensorflow backend.

dual_stream_vgan.py - Our implementation of the dual stream architecture propsed by Vondrick in his paper "Generating Videos with Scene Dynamics". Written with Keras using a Tensorflow backend.

requirments.txt - A list of the required python packages need to recreate the environment we used to run the scripts single_stream_vgan.py and dual_stream_vegan.py


main_mine.lua - Torch code built by Vondirck to train the CVGAN our project is based on with updates made by our team to train on the UCF-101 data set. 

generator.lua -  Torch code built by Vondrick used for testing, evaluating our outputs and generating videos trained with main_mine.Lua
